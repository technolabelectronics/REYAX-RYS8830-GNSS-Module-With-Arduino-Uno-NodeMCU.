# INTRODUCTION
Hello friends, Welcome to another article, In this article we will  learn how to use world smallest GPS and GNSS Module. and the module is  RYS8830, which is sent to me by REYAX technology.
Whenever we make any project which required location, for example a tracking device , we often use NEO-6M GPS Module, 
This module is good for retrieving location and date but the size of this module is not generous,
So we have restrictions over size, We can't make our project as small as we want.
So to solve this problem Reyax has developed a new GPS and GNSS Module, which is way smaller than the NEO-6M GPS Module.
As you can see side by side comparison of both the module. These two module has good amount of size difference.
As you can see REYAX RYS8830 is very tiny and I can easily held in my finger tip.

And apart from the size, the power consumption of this module is also very low. due to its low power consumption and  small form factor, we can use this module in lots of applications, like in wearable electronic devices, watches, hand-held devices.
Apart from this module we will also learn about its evolution development board. by using this evolution board we can directly connect GNSS Module to our computer.
And by doing this we can easily communicate with satellite systems.
